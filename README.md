# Clustering-and-Classification
Applying clustering and classification methods to various datasets

# Clustering and Classification Assignment

This practical assignment focuses on applying **clustering** and **classification** methods to various datasets. You are required to choose and complete three out of the four proposed topics.

## Topics

1. **Clustering and Classification on the Iris Dataset**
   - Apply clustering methods to the Iris dataset.
   - Visualize and interpret the results.
   - Use the k-NN method to create a confusion matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Mammal Dentition Dataset**
   - Apply clustering methods to the mammal.dentition dataset.
   - Determine the best clustering method.
   - Classify animals manually or use a provided classification, then apply k-NN and create a confusion matrix.
   - Find the optimal value for \( k \).

3. **Analyzing the Diabetes Dataset**
   - Examine the diabetes dataset.
   - Apply clustering methods to retrieve the initial classification.
   - Analyze the quality of results using raw and standardized data.
   - Attempt classification using k-NN and comment on the results.
